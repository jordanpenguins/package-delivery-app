# Package Delivery System

A little Single Page Application I made that simulates a package delivery system. The system allows users to create packages, assign them to a driver, and track the package's delivery status.

Created using Angular, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, SocketIO and Google clouds services such as Google Gemini, text to speech, Google Translate. 

## Setup 

1. Run `npm install` in the root directory to install the necessary dependencies for the backend.

2. Run `ng build` in the root directory to build the Angular project.

3. Run `ng serve` in the root directory to start the Angular server.

## Google Export 

Need to run this command in order for Google Gemini and other services to work.

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/Users/jordan_penguins/Documents/Monash/FIT2095/Assignment-3/backend/fit2095.json"
```
